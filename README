## Project Title

AI-Based Multi-Channel Chatbot Platform using Groq LLM

## Description

This project is a **multi-channel AI chatbot platform** (Telegram, WhatsApp, Web) powered by Groq LLM. It features:

- Role-based access (Admin, Manager, User)
- Admin panel for managing clients and users
- JWT-based authentication and session management
- Secure login and logout flows
- Client-specific configurations

## Features

- Multi-channel chatbot support
- AI-powered responses via Groq LLM
- Admin panel with client and user management
- Role-based access control
- JWT authentication and session management
- Secure login, logout, and control flows

## Technology Stack

- Node.js, Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT
- Telegram Bot API, WhatsApp Cloud API, Web chat widget
- Groq LLM API

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-url>

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

BOT_TOKEN=telegram_bot_token
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=whatsapp_api_key
WHATSAPP_NUMBER_ID=whatsapp_number_id
GROQ_API_KEY=groq_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=3000

4. Start the server:

npm start

## Usage

- Users can interact with the chatbot on Telegram, WhatsApp, or Web
- Admins can log in to the Admin Panel to manage clients, users, and system prompts
- JWT tokens handle session management for all roles
- Logout invalidates tokens and ends sessions securely

## Folder Structure

/src
/routes # API routes (auth, clients, users)
/controllers # Business logic
/middlewares # Auth, role-based access
/models # MongoDB schemas
index.js # Entry point
.env # Environment variables

## Role-Based Access & Admin Panel

- **Roles:** Admin, Manager, Support Agent, User
- **Admin:** Full access to all clients and users
- **Manager:** Limited access to assigned clients
- **User:** Chat access only
- **Admin Panel Features:** Client and user management, system prompt configuration, chat log viewing, session monitoring

## JWT Tokens & Session Management

- JWT tokens issued on login for both users and admins
- Tokens contain user ID, role, and expiration
- Sessions stored in MongoDB for tracking active users
- Logout invalidates tokens and updates session status
- Control flows prevent access without valid tokens or roles

## Security Considerations

- API keys and JWT secrets stored in `.env`
- HTTPS enforced for all webhooks and admin panel
- Role-based access prevents unauthorized actions
- Session expiry and token revocation implemented
- Error handling ensures system stability and data protection

## Future Expansion

- Add more channels (Slack, Messenger)
- Client-specific knowledge bases and FAQs
- Human agent handoff when AI confidence is low
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Multi-tier service packages for enterprise clients
- Monitoring, alerts, and audit logs for compliance

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **multi-channel AI chatbot platform** with:

- Groq LLM-powered intelligent responses
- Role-based access control
- Admin panel for managing clients and users
- JWT-based authentication and session management
- Secure login, logout, and control flows

It forms a solid foundation for building **enterprise-ready chatbot services** with scalability and multi-client support.
